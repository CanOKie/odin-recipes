    <p><h2>Cheezy Grilled Cheese</h2>
    <p><strong>Oh so good!</strong>  This takes the standard grilled cheese and kicks it up a notch. It all starts with two different cheeses and crispy bread.  Simple <em>BUT</em>TASTY!!!
    <p>You cannot deny a childhood favorite.  Dive into this grilled cheese and you'll be back to make more!
    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Two slices of bread</li>
        <li><em>Generous</em> Amounts of shreaded mozzerella and colby jack sheet (that can be a slice tho)</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoon of butter</li>
      </ul>
    <p><h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat A Pan on Your Stove Top on High</li>
        <li>Put 1 Tablespoon of butter for each side (2 in total)</li>
        <li>Once the Pan is hot, put a slice of buttered bread face down and turn the temp to Low</li>
        <li>Quickly add the shreaded mozzerella and <em>LOTS OF IT</em></li>
        <li>Place the slice of Colby Jack on top and place the other buttered bread on top (butter facing up)</li>
        <li>Wait for the mozzerella to start to melt and flip the grilled cheese over.  You should have a nice golden brown crust on top.  If not, we will repeat this process again but not right now</li>
        <li>Wait 4-5 mins and check the bread on the bottom of the pan.  If its golden Brown, flip it again</li>
        <li>Wait another 1-2 mins and flip it again.</li>
        <li><strong>Turn Off the Heat</strong>Put that grilled cheese on a plate and cut it diagonally.  It tasts better when cut at an angle.</li>
